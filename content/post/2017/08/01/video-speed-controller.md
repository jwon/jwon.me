I&#8217;ve recently downloaded the [Video Speed Controller Chrome Extension][1] and I have to say, it changed my life.

Even if college, I would always watch lecture recordings at 1.5x or 2x speed. However, for the most part, that was confined to downloading a copy of the video file and manually changing the video speed through a video player like VLC.

With this Chrome extension, you can change the video playback speed of any HTML5 video!~

I like the introduction on their [Github page][2]:

> TL;DR: faster playback translates to better engagement and retention.
> 
> Average adult reads prose text at 250 to 300 words per minute (wpm). By contrast, the average rate of speech for English speakers is ~150 wpm, with slide presentations often closer to 100 wpm. As a result, when given the choice, many viewers speed up video playback to ~1.3~1.5 its recorded rate to compensate for the difference.
> 
> Many viewers report that accelerated viewing keeps their attention longer: faster delivery keeps the viewer more engaged with the content. In fact, with a little training many end up watching videos at 2x+ the recorded speed. Some studies report that after being exposed to accelerated playback, listeners become uncomfortable if they are forced to return to normal rate of presentation. 

Install and enjoy!~
