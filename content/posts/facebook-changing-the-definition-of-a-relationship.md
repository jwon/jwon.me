**Facebook**. A social networking site that now has over 500 million active users, and as [stated][1] by Hitwise, now the **Most Visited Website in 2010**. It is undoubtedly changing the vast realm of socializing.

But before I start talking about Facebook, let me first tell you about how I actually use the service.

Facebook, for me, is a medium to post **links**, to share what I've **discovered** on the internet, and also to see what **photos** I'm tagged in. If there is one thing I commend Facebook, it is for their **photo tagging service**. Never have I thought how **convenient** it would be to look at all the photos of a person (regardless of who took the photo). However, rarely do I stare at my **news feed**, rarely do I visit other people's **profiles**, and only when I am extremely bored, would I even consider playing a Facebook **game**.

**One thing that I want bring to attention is the way Facebook is subtly changing the definition of a relationship between two different people.**

People stalk their friends on Facebook all day, and get a sense of closeness with the person; inadvertently creating a misconception that they ***know*** the person. When they actually meet a friend in real life, they talk about things that they posted or seen on each other's profiles. Is this what a friendship is? Is this what close friends are like? **Facebook rids relationships of their deepness, and strives for contentment on a surface-level connection.**

And what's up with Facebook changing "**wall-to-wall**" to "**see friendship**"? Once again, they're subtly **promoting the idea that a friendship is what it says on that friendship page.**

I guess internet addictions come and go, but I've never seen so many people **block** (or change the password to their) Facebook during **finals season**, which portrays the **addictive nature** this service. People ***need*** to be on Facebook to feel **connected**, to feel like the know **what's going on**. I guess this is similar to **gossiping**, but once this **starts to dictate the relationships** a person has with his or her friends, I feel that that's when it **gets out of line**.

I fear the day when people will need to be on Facebook to get to know their friends, or just to feel sociable. But, oh wait. It's already happening.
