I've recently joined a new team where Go (Golang) is used, so I've been spending time learning the language. My primary programming language is Python and it is the language I am profficient in far more than any other language. As a result, most of my programming idioms are very Pythonic and I think in Python when I code.

I don't recall who said this, but I've heard that the *second* programming language you learn is the hardest. Since you've already built up a lot of assumptions and idioms of how programming should work with your first, it can be challenging to quickly learn a second one. And then once you've mastered your second, learning your third and fourth become significantly easier.


That being said, there are plenty of resources out there to help people learn Go.

Here are a couple:

* [Tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1) - The "official" tutorial on learning Go. Definitely helps and gives you a good overview of all of Go. My only qualm is that it is quite slow moving in the beginning.
* [Go for Python Programmers](https://golang-for-python-programmers.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) - I haven't finished going through this yet, but I've had a really good first impression. It assumes you are already a Python programmer so it doesn't spend too much time on covering programming concepts but only things that are specific to Go.

I hope to blog more about my experiences learning Go as well as some of the idiosyncrasies of the language!
