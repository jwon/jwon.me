So, I use the [Logitech Master MX Mouse][1]. One of the things I really like about it is that it has a side-scrolling wheel at the left-side of the mouse:

![][2]

However, the problem with using the side-scrolling wheel and Google Chrome is that whenever I try to scroll left, Google Chrome interprets that as me trying to do the Back movement and go back a page.

However, for OS X, there is a quick fix!

Open up your terminal and run this:
```bash
defaults write com.google.Chrome AppleEnableMouseSwipeNavigateWithScrolls -bool false
```

That should fix your issue!

Happy scrolling. ðŸ™‚
