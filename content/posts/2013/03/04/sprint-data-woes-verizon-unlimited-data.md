Sprint is currently the only carrier in the United States that currently offers Unlimited Data to customers. However, what does this "unlimited data" really mean?

I've been with Sprint for over 4 years now, since they boasted about being the very first carrier to have 4G (remember their failed Wimax implementation?) and even to the point where they became the only carrier providing unlimited data plans as competitors moved to tiered data plans.

Seems pretty good right?

Unfortunately, my experience with Sprint reception as been terrible. Throughout my entire time with Sprint, I've been plagued with spotty reception, slow data speeds, and barely any 4G service. Yes, I am paying for this unlimited data plan, but what's the point if I can't even fully utilize it? During their Wimax implementation, I had the EVO 4G (also known as the OG EVO), but I think I only got 4G once with the 2 years I was on that phone (and it was only in LA). Then I upgraded to the EVO 4g LTE (which by the way, at the time of release, did not even have a LTE network to use). Now, I seldom get LTE (in SF mostly), but I definitely can I say I feel like I'm getting the worth of my $10 4G premium data fee that I'm paying monthly.

I talked to my friends, and I came to the conclusion that Verizon definitely has the best coverage for both 3g AND LTE). I'm amazed at how consistently Verizon customers receive 4G, which I'm stuck on 3g that is barely usable. Yes, Verizon is much more expensive, but I believe that paying for a service that you can actually use is worth it.

Unfortunately, Verizon does not offer unlimited data plans anymore, and only offer tiered data plans. Fortunately though, they allowed old customers who had unlimited data to be grandfathered, meaning that if you had the unlimited data, then you were able to keep it as long as you didn't receive an upgrade subsidy on a new phone.

Thus, I began my search to purchase a Verizon phone line that had unlimited data. Since you can't technically "buy " a phone line, I was looking to do an Assumption of Liability (also known as a Transfer of Liability) on a phone line that someone currently owned. I looked on ebay and people were willing to do so for a premium of $250+. I thought it was pretty ridiculous, but at the same time, I really wanted to get a Verizon unlimited data plan.

After much hunting, I fortunately found someone at a forum who wanted to give away his unlimited data line, so I was gladly willing to accept, and now I have a line! However, I currently don't have a Verizon phone, so it's currently inactive, but I want to get a phone ASAP so that I can start using my Verizon line!

I think I'm looking into either the Samsung Galaxy S3 or the Samsung Galaxy Note 2, because they both have a GSM radio (even though Verizon operates on a CDMA network), and thus can be used as a world phone if traveling abroad. We'll see though. Since I can never purchase a phone from Verizon with the upgrade subsidy, I have to buy the phone full price, which is pretty expensive. I'll see what I can do though.

What am I going to do about my Sprint line? Well, I still have over a year left on the contract... And as of now, if I cancel the line, I will have to pay an ETF (Early Termination Fee). So, here are my choices I think:

  * Keep my Sprint line (just don't use it), and use my Verizon line
  * Pay the Early Termination Fee, and transfer my number to Sprint
  * Open a new line on Sprint (month-to-month), transfer my number to that line, then transfer that number out to Verizon. Keep the Sprint line on contract until contract expires then cancel.

I'm not sure what I should do. I'm still thinking about it.
