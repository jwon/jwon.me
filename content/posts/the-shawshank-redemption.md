I watched [The Shawshank Redemption][1]Â the other day and omg, it was a good movie. =O

I've always heard people talk about it, how it's on people's top movies lists, but I never had the opportunity to see it. I stayed up til 2am watching this on a day where I had work the next day, and it was most definitely worth it. =)

I enjoyed watching it a lot, and I definitely recommend you watch it as well if you haven't already!
