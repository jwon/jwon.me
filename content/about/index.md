Hi, I am a Python Programmer and Site Reliability Engineer based out of the Bay Area. I'm a privacy enthusiast, Linux geek, and into home networking.

My blog is mostly a collection of random thoughts, but I hope that it can provide some value to you!

## Privacy
My GPG public key is `EC2E9E6F61323ACDFAFF1F7E7661DC2BFE895590`. You can also find this info at my [keybase.io profile](https://keybase.io/jwon).

## Tor Relay
I also run a [Tor relay](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/TorRelayGuide) on Azure. Check out its [relay metrics](https://metrics.torproject.org/rs.html#details/923CA0B5514F85F6CB44E2CFD356213421358470)! Its fingerprint is `923CA0B5514F85F6CB44E2CFD356213421358470`. I'm trying to get the Guard flag, but for some reason, every time I get it, I lose it for some reason. If you have any idea what's happening, please let me know!
