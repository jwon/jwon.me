Hi, I am a Python & Go Programmer and Site Reliability Engineer based out of the Bay Area. I'm a privacy enthusiast, Linux geek, and into home networking.

My blog is mostly a collection of random thoughts, but I hope that it can provide some value to you!

## Privacy
My GPG public key is `247C8B45911A9C1C56C2746C7C186E12A149CCB3`. You can also find this info at my [keybase.io profile](https://keybase.io/jwon).

## Vim
I am an avid Vim user and I recently switched over to [Neovim](https://neovim.io/). You can check out my Neovim config in my [dotfiles repo](https://github.com/jwon/dotfiles/blob/master/nvim/.config/nvim/init.vim).

## My humble homelab
My home isn't big enough to have space for a network rack, so I'm all about low-power devices. I currently have a pfsense router, Unifi switches, and Unifi APs.

I have a Synology DS412+ which is a 4-bay NAS that I got in 2012. I am looking to explore ZFS and either thinking of building my own TrueNAS box or buying the TrueNAS Mini.

I currently only use my NAS as a file server and for Plex, but I want to expand the scope of it to include collecting metrics and running Home Assistant.
